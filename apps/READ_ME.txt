DISCLAIMER
all of the code in this directory was written as an excercise while learning Python. 
It may include some obvious beginner mistakes that I have learned not to commit since.

This especially refers to korona_app, which was written without knowledge of pandas that I would use while working with csv/txt files
and thus avoid the unnecessarily big number of additional files.
