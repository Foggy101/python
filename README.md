# PYTHON MISCELLANEOUS
## IMPORTANT!
A significant portion of the code here was written when I was just starting to use Python. 
There are many bad practices present in these files, especially in the 'apps' and 'games' sections. 
<br>However, I decided not to spend time rewriting my old work, as I prefer to focus on more data science and machine learning-related subjects. 
Additionally, I believe leaving it as it is will serve as a good indicator of my progress.
